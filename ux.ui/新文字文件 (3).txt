1.User-Centered Design Basics 
•	Specify the context of use: Identify the people who will use the product, what they will use it for, and under what conditions they will use it.
•	Specify requirements: Identify any business requirements or user goals that must be met for the product to be successful.
•	Create design solutions: This part of the process may be done in stages, building from a rough concept to a complete design.
•	Evaluate designs: Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.
